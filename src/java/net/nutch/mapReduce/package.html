<p>A system for scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed computation over
large data collections.</p>

<p>Applications implement {@link net.nutch.mapReduce.Mapper} and
{@link net.nutch.mapReduce.Reducer} interfaces.  These are submitted
as a {@link net.nutch.mapReduce.MapReduceJob} and are applied to data
stored in a {@link net.nutch.fs.NutchFileSystem}.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">Google's
original Map/Reduce paper</a> for background information.</p>
